                The Netherlands, located in Northwestern Europe, is known for its flat landscape, windmills, tulip fields, and
                progressive social policies. Amsterdam is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 17.5
                million people. Dutch is the official language, and the currency is the Euro (EUR). The Netherlands operates as
                a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system.
