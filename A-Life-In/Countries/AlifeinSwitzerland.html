                Switzerland, located in Central Europe, is renowned for its pristine Alpine landscapes, high standard of
                living, and neutrality in international affairs. Bern is the de facto capital, while Zurich and Geneva are major
                financial centers. Switzerland has a population of approximately 8.6 million people. The country has four
                official languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh. The Swiss Franc (CHF) is the currency, and Switzerland
                operates as a federal republic with a system of direct democracy.

                Switzerland does not have a statutory minimum wage at the national level but wages are generally high due to
                strong collective bargaining agreements and labor market regulations. The healthcare system is universal, with
                private and public insurance options ensuring comprehensive coverage for all residents. Education is highly
                regarded and public schools are of high quality, with options for international and private schooling available.

                Politically, Switzerland is known for its decentralized system with 26 cantons, each having considerable
                autonomy over local governance and administration. The country's commitment to direct democracy allows citizens
                to participate actively in decision-making through referendums and initiatives.
                <br><br>
                The cost of living in Switzerland is among the highest in the world, particularly in cities like Zurich, Geneva,

                compensate for these expenses.
                <br><br>
