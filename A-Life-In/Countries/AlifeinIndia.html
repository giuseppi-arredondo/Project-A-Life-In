        <p class="FormatP">India, located in South Asia, is known for its cultural diversity, rich history, and rapid economic growth. New
            Delhi is the capital, while Mumbai is the largest city, with a population of over 1.3 billion people. Hindi and
            English are the official languages, and the currency is the Indian Rupee (INR). India operates as a federal
            parliamentary democratic republic.
    
            People are attracted to living in India for its vibrant culture, spiritual heritage, diverse cuisine, and
            entrepreneurial opportunities. Notable personalities from India include Mahatma Gandhi (leader of the Indian
            independence movement), Jawaharlal Nehru (first Prime Minister), and Sachin Tendulkar (cricketer).
    
            India's minimum wage varies significantly by state and sector, with monthly wages ranging from approximately
            7,000 to 15,000 INR, which is roughly equivalent to 90 to 200 USD depending on the exchange rate. The healthcare
            system in India is a mix of public and private providers, with access and quality varying widely across the
            country. Education is compulsory and free up to the age of 14, with efforts underway to improve access and
            quality of education nationwide.
    
            Politically, India is known for its robust democracy, with regular elections and a diverse political landscape.
            The country is divided into states and union territories, each with its own local government and administrative
            structure.
    
            The cost of living in India varies significantly by region, with major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore
            being more expensive than rural areas. Housing, food, and transportation costs can be relatively affordable,
            though urban areas experience higher costs.
    
            India's economy is diverse, with key industries including information technology (IT), pharmaceuticals,
            agriculture, manufacturing, and services. The country has experienced rapid economic growth and
            industrialization, contributing to its emergence as a global economic powerhouse.
    
            Emigrating to India can involve various pathways, including work visas, investment visas, and family
            reunification visas. The country welcomes skilled professionals, entrepreneurs, and investors who can contribute
            to its economic development and innovation.
    
            In summary, India offers a blend of cultural richness, economic opportunities, and spiritual heritage. Its
            dynamic democracy, diverse society, and growing economy make it an attractive destination for individuals and
            families seeking new experiences and opportunities in South Asia.</p>
