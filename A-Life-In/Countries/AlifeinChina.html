    <!-- INFO -->
    <section class="info-country content-section">
        <p>
        China, located in East Asia, is the world's most populous country with over 1.4 billion people. Beijing is the
        capital, Mandarin is the official language and the currency is the Yuan (CNY). China is governed centrally by the
        Communist Party and arranged into provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
        </p>

        <p>
        People are drawn to China for its history, culture and major economic opportunities. Sectors like manufacturing,
        e-commerce, AI and green tech grow fast. Notable figures include Jackie Chan, Yao Ming and Liu Cixin.
        </p>

        <p>
        Minimum wages vary by region (Beijing/Shanghai higher than smaller cities). Healthcare mixes public and private
        provision; basic coverage is widely available. Education and local regulations vary by province.
        </p>

        <p>
        Moving to China typically requires the correct visa (work, study, investor, family). Large cities run talent
        attraction programs; preparing documents and understanding local rules in advance is essential.
        </p>

        <p>
        In short: China offers scale and opportunity but also regulatory and cultural particularities — great for people who
        research, adapt and work with local partners.
