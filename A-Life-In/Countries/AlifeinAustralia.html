        <p class="FormatP">Australia, located in the Southern Hemisphere, is both a country and a continent. It has a population of
            approximately 26 million people, with Canberra as its capital and Sydney as its largest city. English is the
            official language, and the currency is the Australian dollar (AUD). Australia operates as a federal
            parliamentary constitutional monarchy.
    
            People are attracted to living in Australia for its high standard of living, excellent healthcare and education
            systems, diverse and vibrant cities, and stunning natural landscapes. The country is known for its friendly and
            multicultural society. Notable personalities from Australia include Chris Hemsworth (actor), Hugh Jackman
            (actor), and Kylie Minogue (singer).
    
            Australia's minimum wage in 2024 is approximately 21.38 AUD per hour, which translates to around 3,240 AUD per
            month, or approximately 2,140 USD per month. The healthcare system, known as Medicare, provides free or
            subsidized access to a wide range of medical services. Additionally, Australia has a robust private healthcare
            sector. Education in Australia is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 17, and the country boasts a high
            standard of education with a strong emphasis on literacy and numeracy.
    
            Politically, Australia is a stable democracy with a strong tradition of political freedom and active citizen
            participation. The government structure includes a federal system with powers divided between the national
            government and individual states and territories.
    
            The cost of living in Australia varies by region, with Sydney and Melbourne being among the most expensive
            cities. However, the high wages and quality of public services often offset the higher living costs.
    
            Australia's economy is strong and diverse, with significant contributions from sectors such as mining,
            agriculture, and services. The country has experienced steady economic growth over the past few decades.
            However, it is not without challenges, including housing affordability issues in major cities and environmental
            concerns related to climate change and resource management.
    
            Emigrating to Australia can be relatively straightforward for qualified individuals. Common pathways include
            skilled migration visas, employer-sponsored visas, and family reunification visas. Australia has a points-based
            immigration system that favors skilled workers with relevant qualifications and work experience.
    
            In summary, Australia offers a high quality of life, excellent public services, and a welcoming environment for
            newcomers. Its strong economy, stable political system, and beautiful natural landscapes make it an attractive
            destination for people looking to emigrate.</p>
