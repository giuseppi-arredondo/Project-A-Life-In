                The United Kingdom (UK), consisting of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, is located off the
                northwest coast of mainland Europe. London is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately
                67 million people. English is the official language, and the currency is the British Pound Sterling (GBP). The
                UK operates as a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy.

                People are attracted to living in the UK for its rich cultural heritage, world-class universities, diverse
                cities, and historic landmarks such as Buckingham Palace and Stonehenge. Notable personalities associated with
                the UK include William Shakespeare (playwright), Queen Elizabeth II (monarch), and Adele (singer).
                <br><br>
                The minimum wage in the UK varies depending on age and is updated annually. As of 2024, the National Living Wage
                for workers aged 23 and over is approximately £9.50 per hour, equivalent to around £1,850 per month based on
                full-time work.
                <br><br>
                The healthcare system in the UK is known as the National Health Service (NHS), providing comprehensive and
                largely free healthcare services to residents. Education is compulsory for children aged 5 to 18, with
                state-funded schools providing free education up to the age of 16, and further education available at colleges
                and universities.
                <br><br>
                Politically, the UK is known for its stable democracy, with a parliamentary system and regular elections. It is
                divided into four constituent countries, each with its own devolved administration responsible for various
                aspects of public policy.
                <br><br>
                The cost of living in the UK varies significantly by region, with London and the southeast generally being more
                expensive than other parts of the country. Housing, transportation, and food costs are major expenses, though
                salaries in urban areas often reflect the higher living costs.
                <br><br>
                The UK's economy is diverse, with key industries including financial services (London is a global financial
                hub), manufacturing (automobiles, aerospace), pharmaceuticals, creative industries (film, music, fashion), and
                technology. The country has a strong emphasis on innovation and research, supporting economic growth and global
                competitiveness.
                <br><br>
                Emigrating to the UK is possible through various pathways, including work visas, study visas, family
                reunification visas, and investment visas. The country welcomes skilled professionals, students, and
                entrepreneurs who can contribute to its economy and cultural diversity.
                <br><br>
