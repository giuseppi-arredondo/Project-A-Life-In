        <p class="FormatP">Croatia, located in Southeast Europe along the Adriatic Sea, is known for its stunning coastline, historic
            cities, and rich cultural heritage. Zagreb is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 4
            million people. Croatian is the official language, and the currency is the Croatian kuna (HRK). Croatia operates
            as a parliamentary republic.
    
            People are attracted to living in Croatia for its Mediterranean climate, beautiful beaches, outdoor recreational
            opportunities, and preserved historical sites. Notable personalities from Croatia include Luka ModriÄ‡
            (footballer), Nikola Tesla (inventor), and Goran IvaniÅ¡eviÄ‡ (tennis player).
    
            Croatia's minimum wage in 2024 is approximately 4,250 HRK per month, which is roughly equivalent to 650 USD
            depending on the exchange rate. The healthcare system in Croatia is universal, with coverage provided through
            public health insurance. Education is compulsory and free in primary and secondary schools, with a focus on
            achieving high literacy rates and educational outcomes.
    
            Politically, Croatia is a member of the European Union (EU) and operates within a democratic framework with
            regular elections and a commitment to human rights and rule of law. The country is divided into counties and
            cities, each with its own local government and administrative structure.
    
            The cost of living in Croatia varies by region, with coastal cities like Dubrovnik and Split being more
            expensive than inland areas. Housing, food, and transportation are significant expenses, though salaries and
            social benefits help offset these costs.
    
            Croatia's economy is diverse, with key industries including tourism, manufacturing, agriculture, and services.
            The country has benefited from EU membership, which has supported economic growth and infrastructure
            development.
    
            Emigrating to Croatia is possible through various channels, including work visas, student visas, and family
            reunification visas. The country welcomes skilled workers and investors who can contribute to its economy and
            cultural diversity.
    
            In summary, Croatia offers a mix of natural beauty, cultural richness, and economic stability. Its EU
            membership, democratic governance, and commitment to sustainable development make it an attractive destination
            for individuals and families seeking opportunities in Europe.</p>
