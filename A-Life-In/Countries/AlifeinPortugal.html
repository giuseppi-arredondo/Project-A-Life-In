                Portugal, located in Southern Europe on the Iberian Peninsula, is known for its historic cities, stunning
                coastline, and warm climate. Lisbon is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 10.3
                million people. Portuguese is the official language, and the currency is the Euro (EUR). Portugal operates as a
                democratic republic.

                People are attracted to living in Portugal for its rich cultural heritage, affordable cost of living, beautiful
                beaches, and relaxed lifestyle. Notable personalities from Portugal include Cristiano Ronaldo (footballer), José
                Saramago (Nobel laureate in literature), and Amália Rodrigues (fado singer).
                <br><br>
                Portugal's minimum wage in 2024 is approximately 775 EUR per month, which is roughly equivalent to 865 USD
                depending on the exchange rate. The healthcare system in Portugal is universal and funded through general
                taxation, providing comprehensive medical services to all residents. Education is free and compulsory up to the
                age of 18, with efforts to improve educational quality and access.
                <br><br>
                Politically, Portugal is known for its stable democracy, with a parliamentary system and regular elections. The
                country is divided into regions and municipalities, each with its own local government and administrative
                responsibilities.
                <br><br>
                The cost of living in Portugal varies by region, with Lisbon, Porto, and Algarve being popular but more expensive
                areas. Housing, utilities, and food costs are significant expenses, though generally more affordable compared to
                many other Western European countries.
                <br><br>
                Portugal's economy is diversified, with key industries including tourism, textiles, wine production (especially
                port wine), agriculture (such as cork and olives), and increasingly, technology and renewable energy sectors.
                The country has seen economic growth and development, particularly in recent years following structural reforms
                and EU integration.
                <br><br>
                Emigrating to Portugal is feasible through various pathways, including work visas, study visas, and retirement
                visas (Golden Visa). The country welcomes skilled workers, students, entrepreneurs, and retirees who can
                contribute to its economy and cultural diversity.
                <br><br>
                In summary, Portugal offers a blend of cultural richness, economic stability, and natural beauty. Its
                Mediterranean climate, historic cities, and friendly atmosphere make it an attractive destination for
                individuals and families seeking a high quality of life in Southern Europe.
