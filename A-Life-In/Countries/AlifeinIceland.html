                Iceland, located in the North Atlantic Ocean, is known for its stunning landscapes, geothermal hot springs, and
                vibrant culture. Reykjavik is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 370,000 people.
                Icelandic is the official language, and the currency is the Icelandic Króna (ISK). Iceland operates as a
                parliamentary republic.
                <br><br>
                People are attracted to living in Iceland for its pristine natural environment, outdoor recreational
                opportunities (such as hiking and whale watching), low crime rate, and strong sense of community. Notable
                personalities from Iceland include Björk (singer), Halldór Laxness (Nobel laureate in literature), and Jóhanna
                Sigurðardóttir (former Prime Minister).
                <br><br>
                Iceland's minimum wage in 2024 is approximately 317,000 ISK per month, roughly equivalent to 2,500 USD. The
                healthcare system is publicly funded and provides universal coverage, ensuring access to comprehensive medical
                services for all residents. Education is free and compulsory up to age 16, with further education subsidized at
                higher levels.
                <br><br>
                Politically, Iceland is known for its strong democratic traditions, gender equality, and transparent governance.
                The country is divided into regions and municipalities, each with its own local administration.
                <br><br>
                The cost of living in Iceland is relatively high, particularly in Reykjavik and other urban areas. Housing,
                utilities, and imported goods can be expensive, but high salaries and social benefits help offset these costs.
                <br><br>
                The economy focuses on fisheries, renewable energy (geothermal and hydroelectric power), tourism, and technology.
                Sustainability and environmental protection are central to Iceland’s policies and growth model.
                <br><br>
                In summary, Iceland offers breathtaking natural beauty, a high quality of life, and a society built on equality
                and sustainability — an ideal destination for those seeking peace, safety, and harmony with nature.
