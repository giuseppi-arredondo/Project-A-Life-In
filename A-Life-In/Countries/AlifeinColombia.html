        <h1>A Life in Colombia</h1>
        <!-- <img src="../Flags/Colombia.png" alt="üá®üá¥ Flag of Colombia" class="imgFlag"> -->
        <p class="FormatP">Colombia, located in South America, is known for its diverse culture, vibrant cities, and rich biodiversity.
            Bogot√° is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 50 million people. Spanish is the
            official language, and the currency is the Colombian peso (COP). Colombia operates as a unitary republic with a
            presidential system of government.
    
            People are attracted to living in Colombia for its warm climate, friendly people, cultural diversity, and
            natural beauty. Notable personalities from Colombia include Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez (author), Shakira (singer),
            and Juanes (musician).
    
            Colombia's minimum wage in 2024 is approximately 1,102,000 COP per month, which is roughly equivalent to 270 USD
            depending on the exchange rate. The healthcare system in Colombia is a mix of public and private providers, with
            universal coverage provided through public insurance schemes. Education is compulsory and free in public schools
            up to secondary education, with efforts ongoing to improve access and quality nationwide.
    
            Politically, Colombia has a stable democratic system with regular elections and a history of peaceful
            transitions of power. The country is divided into departments, each with its own local government and
            administrative structure.
    
            The cost of living in Colombia varies by region, with major cities like Bogot√° and Medell√≠n being more expensive
            than rural areas. Housing, transportation, and utilities are significant expenses for urban residents, although
            salaries and social benefits help mitigate these costs.
    
            Colombia's economy is diverse, with key industries including mining (especially coal and gold), agriculture,
            manufacturing, and services. The country has benefited from economic reforms and trade agreements, contributing
            to its economic growth and development.
    
            Emigrating to Colombia is relatively straightforward for individuals with the right qualifications and
            resources. Common pathways include work visas, investment visas, and family reunification visas. Colombia
            welcomes foreign investment and offers incentives for entrepreneurs and investors looking to establish
            businesses or invest in local industries.
    
            In summary, Colombia offers a blend of cultural richness, natural beauty, and economic potential. Its democratic
            governance, expanding economy, and commitment to social development make it an attractive destination for
            individuals and families seeking opportunities in South America.</p>
