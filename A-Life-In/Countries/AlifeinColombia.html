        Colombia is warm, vibrant and diverse — from Andes peaks to Caribbean beaches. Below is a quick guide
        that highlights why many consider Colombia an exciting place to live, work and grow.

    <!-- INFO -->
    <section class="info-country content-section">
        <p>
        Colombia, located in northwest South America, is known for its rich biodiversity, vibrant culture and varied landscapes.
        Bogotá is the capital and Medellín and Cartagena are major urban and cultural centers. Spanish is the official language,
        and the currency is the Colombian peso (COP).
        </p>

        <p>
        People are attracted to Colombia for its warm climate in many regions, friendly communities, music and food culture,
        and improving economic opportunities. Notable Colombians include Gabriel García Márquez (writer) and Shakira (singer).
        </p>

        <p>
        The 2024 minimum wage is approximately 1,102,000 COP per month (about ~270 USD, variable by exchange rate). Healthcare
        is provided via a mixed public-private system with broad coverage; education is compulsory and public through secondary levels.
        </p>

        <p>
        Politically, Colombia is a democratic republic divided into departments with local governments. The cost of living depends
        on city vs countryside — Bogotá and Medellín are more expensive than many coastal or rural areas.
        </p>

        <p>
        Colombia’s economy includes agriculture, mining, manufacturing and services. The country actively seeks investment and has
        multiple visa paths for workers, investors and students.
        </p>

        <p>
        In short: Colombia offers culture, nature and entrepreneurship potential — great for people who want variety, community and
        a friendly, lively lifestyle.
