                Denmark, the heart of Scandinavia, is known for its balance between modern living, sustainability, and tradition. 
                With a strong welfare system, vibrant cities, and a deep sense of community, it’s often ranked as one of the happiest nations in the world.

            <h2>Culture and Lifestyle</h2>
            <p>
                The Danish concept of <strong>“hygge”</strong> defines their lifestyle — it’s about comfort, warmth, and enjoying simple moments, 
                whether that means coffee with friends or a cozy night indoors. Danish people value equality, trust, and work-life balance above all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Copenhagen, the capital, stands as a global example of sustainability and design innovation. Biking is a part of everyday life — 
                in fact, there are more bicycles than cars in the city.
            </p>

            <h2>Economy and Innovation</h2>
            <p>
                Denmark’s economy is one of the most stable in Europe, with key industries in renewable energy, pharmaceuticals, shipping, and design. 
                It’s also home to major global companies such as LEGO, Maersk, and Vestas.
            </p>

            <h2>Geography and Nature</h2>
            <p>
                The country is made up of over 400 islands, most connected by impressive bridges. With flat landscapes and long coastlines, 
                Denmark’s natural beauty lies in its simplicity and the harmony between nature and urban spaces.
            </p>

            <h2>Education and Welfare</h2>
            <p>
                Education is free for all residents, and the healthcare system is publicly funded. 
                Danish universities consistently rank among the best in Europe for research and innovation.
