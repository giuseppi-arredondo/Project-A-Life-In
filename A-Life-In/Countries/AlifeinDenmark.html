            Denmark is a compact northern-European country famous for safety, strong social systems and excellent quality of life.
            Below are quick facts and practical notes for anyone thinking about moving to Denmark.

            Denmark, located in Northern Europe, is known for its high standard of living, progressive social policies, and a strong welfare
            state. Copenhagen is the capital. Danish is the official language and the currency is the Danish krone (DKK).
        </p>

        <p class="FormatP">
            People move to Denmark for excellent healthcare and education, great work–life balance, and bike-friendly cities.
            The economy is stable with strengths in pharmaceuticals, clean energy and shipping.
        </p>

        <p class="FormatP">
            Unlike many countries, Denmark does not have a single national minimum wage: pay is set via collective bargaining.
            Public services are robust and social protections significant—this is balanced by higher tax rates.
        </p>

        <p class="FormatP">
            Common immigration routes include skilled work permits, study visas, and family reunification. Learning basic Danish helps
            integration but many Danes speak excellent English.
