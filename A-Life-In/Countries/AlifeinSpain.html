        <p class="FormatP">Spain, located in southwestern Europe, is known for its diverse culture, vibrant cities, beautiful beaches, and
            rich historical heritage. Madrid is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 47 million
            people. Spanish is the official language, and the currency is the Euro (EUR). Spain operates as a parliamentary
            constitutional monarchy.
    
            People are attracted to living in Spain for its Mediterranean climate, relaxed lifestyle, culinary delights
            (including tapas and paella), and cultural attractions such as Gaudi's architecture in Barcelona and historic
            landmarks like the Alhambra in Granada. Notable personalities from Spain include Pablo Picasso (artist),
            Pen√©lope Cruz (actress), and Rafael Nadal (tennis player).
    
            Spain's minimum wage in 2024 is approximately 1,100 EUR per month, which is roughly equivalent to 1,225 USD
            depending on the exchange rate. The healthcare system in Spain is universal and public, providing comprehensive
            coverage through the National Health System (SNS). Education is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 16,
            with further education subsidized for higher levels.
    
            Politically, Spain is known for its stable democracy, with regular elections and a decentralized system of
            government. The country is divided into autonomous communities and provinces, each with its own local government
            and administrative responsibilities.
    
            The cost of living in Spain varies by region, with major cities like Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia being more
            expensive than rural areas. Housing, utilities, and food costs are significant expenses, though living expenses
            can be relatively affordable compared to other Western European countries.
    
            Spain's economy is diverse, with key industries including tourism (especially along the Mediterranean coast),
            manufacturing (automobiles and textiles), agriculture (olives and citrus fruits), and renewable energy. The
            country benefits from its strategic location, cultural heritage, and strong ties to Latin America.
    
            Emigrating to Spain is feasible through various pathways, including work visas, study visas, and retirement
            visas. The country welcomes skilled workers, students, retirees, and investors who can contribute to its economy
            and cultural diversity.
    
            In summary, Spain offers a blend of cultural richness, economic opportunities, and Mediterranean lifestyle. Its
            warm climate, historic cities, and diverse landscapes make it an attractive destination for individuals and
            families seeking a vibrant European experience.</p>
