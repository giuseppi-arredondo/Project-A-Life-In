            France, located in Western Europe, is known for its rich history, cultural heritage, fashion, and cuisine.
            Paris is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 67 million people. French is the
            official language, and the currency is the Euro (EUR). France operates as a unitary semi-presidential republic.
            <br><br>
            People are attracted to living in France for its diverse landscapes, iconic landmarks (such as the Eiffel Tower
            and Louvre Museum), high standard of living, and strong emphasis on arts, culture, and gastronomy. Notable
            personalities from France include Napoleon Bonaparte (emperor), Coco Chanel (fashion designer), and Zinedine
            Zidane (footballer).
            <br><br>
            France's minimum wage in 2024 is approximately 1,689 EUR per month (around 1,900 USD). The healthcare system
            in France is considered one of the best in the world, offering universal coverage. Education is free and
            compulsory from ages 3 to 16, emphasizing cultural and intellectual development.
            <br><br>
            The cost of living in France varies significantly by region, with Paris being the most expensive city.
            Housing, utilities, and food are major expenses, though public services like healthcare and transport help
            balance these costs.
            <br><br>
            France’s economy is diverse and globally influential, with strong sectors in aerospace, automotive,
            luxury goods, tourism, and agriculture. It is a founding member of the European Union and plays a central role
            in world diplomacy and trade.
            <br><br>
            In summary, France offers a mix of cultural depth, modern lifestyle, and economic opportunity — a place where
            history and innovation coexist harmoniously.
