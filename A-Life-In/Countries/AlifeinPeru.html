        <p class="FormatP">Peru, located in western South America, is known for its rich cultural heritage, diverse landscapes, and
            ancient Incan heritage. Lima is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 33 million
            people. Spanish is the official language, and the currency is the Peruvian Sol (PEN). Peru operates as a
            presidential republic.
    
            People are attracted to living in Peru for its archaeological sites (such as Machu Picchu), culinary delights
            (including ceviche and pisco sour), vibrant festivals, and natural beauty ranging from the Andes Mountains to
            the Amazon rainforest. Notable personalities from Peru include Mario Vargas Llosa (Nobel laureate in
            literature), Gast√≥n Acurio (chef), and Sofia Mulanovich (professional surfer).
    
            Peru's minimum wage varies by sector and region, with the national minimum wage set at approximately 1,200 PEN
            per month, which is roughly equivalent to 300 USD depending on the exchange rate. The healthcare system in Peru
            includes both public and private sectors, with efforts to expand access and improve quality of care across the
            country. Education is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 16, with efforts to enhance educational
            standards nationwide.
    
            Politically, Peru is known for its democratic system, with regular elections and a diverse political landscape.
            The country is divided into regions and provinces, each with its own local government and administrative
            responsibilities.
    
            The cost of living in Peru varies by region, with Lima and other urban centers generally more expensive than
            rural areas. Housing, utilities, and transportation costs are significant, though living expenses can be
            relatively affordable compared to many other countries.
    
            Peru's economy is diverse, with key industries including mining (particularly copper, gold, and silver),
            agriculture (especially coffee and quinoa), tourism, fisheries, and manufacturing. The country benefits from its
            natural resources and strategic location, supporting economic growth and development.
    
            Emigrating to Peru is feasible through various pathways, including work visas, study visas, and family
            reunification visas. The country welcomes skilled professionals, students, and investors who can contribute to
            its economy and cultural diversity.
    
            In summary, Peru offers a blend of cultural richness, natural beauty, and economic opportunities. Its historical
            sites, culinary traditions, and welcoming atmosphere make it an attractive destination for individuals and
            families seeking diverse experiences in South America.</p>
