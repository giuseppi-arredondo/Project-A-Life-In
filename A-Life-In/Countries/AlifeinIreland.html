                Ireland, located in Northwestern Europe, is known for its friendly people, rich cultural heritage, and stunning
                landscapes. Dublin is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 4.9 million people. Irish
                (Gaelic) and English are the official languages, and the currency is the Euro (EUR). Ireland operates as a
                parliamentary republic.

                People are attracted to living in Ireland for its high quality of life, strong sense of community, vibrant arts
                scene, and access to natural beauty. Notable personalities from Ireland include Oscar Wilde (writer), Bono
                (musician), and Michael Fassbender (actor).
                <br><br>
                Ireland's minimum wage in 2024 is approximately 10.50 EUR per hour, which translates to roughly 1,800 EUR per
                month based on a full-time job, or about 2,000 USD depending on the exchange rate. The healthcare system in
                Ireland is a mix of public and private providers, with universal coverage through the public system and private
                insurance options. Education is free and compulsory up to the age of 16, with efforts to improve access and
                quality of education ongoing.

                Politically, Ireland is known for its stable democracy, adherence to rule of law, and active participation in
                international affairs. The country is divided into counties and cities, each with its own local government and
                administrative responsibilities.
                <br><br>
                The cost of living in Ireland varies by region, with Dublin and other urban areas being more expensive than
                rural parts of the country. Housing, utilities, and food costs are significant, though social benefits such as
                healthcare and education help mitigate these expenses.
                <br><br>
                Ireland's economy is diverse, with key industries including pharmaceuticals, technology (particularly IT and
                software development), agriculture, and tourism. The country has a strong focus on innovation and
                entrepreneurship, supporting economic growth and job creation.

                reunification visas. The country welcomes skilled workers, students, and entrepreneurs who can contribute to its
                economy and cultural diversity.
                <br><br>
                In summary, Ireland offers a combination of economic opportunity, cultural richness, and natural beauty. Its
                welcoming atmosphere, strong social welfare system, and emphasis on education and innovation make it an
