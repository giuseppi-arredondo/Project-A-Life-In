        <p class="FormatP">Mexico, located in North America, is known for its rich cultural heritage, diverse landscapes, and vibrant
            traditions. Mexico City is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 126 million people.
            Spanish is the official language, and the currency is the Mexican Peso (MXN). Mexico operates as a federal
            presidential republic.
    
            People are attracted to living in Mexico for its warm climate, delicious cuisine (including tacos and tamales),
            historical sites such as ancient Mayan ruins and colonial cities, and affordable cost of living. Notable
            personalities from Mexico include Frida Kahlo (artist), Carlos Slim (business magnate), and Salma Hayek
            (actress).
    
            Mexico's minimum wage varies by region, with the national minimum wage set at approximately 213 MXN per day,
            which translates to roughly 180 USD per month depending on the exchange rate. The healthcare system in Mexico
            provides both public and private options, with efforts to improve accessibility and quality of care. Education
            is free and compulsory up to the age of 18, with significant efforts to expand access to education across the
            country.
    
            Politically, Mexico is known for its vibrant democracy, diverse political landscape, and regional autonomy. The
            country is divided into states and municipalities, each with its own local government and administrative
            responsibilities.
    
            The cost of living in Mexico varies by region, with major cities like Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara
            being more expensive than rural areas. Housing, food, and transportation costs are relatively affordable
            compared to many Western countries, making Mexico an attractive destination for retirees, expatriates, and
            digital nomads.
    
            Mexico's economy is diverse, with key industries including automotive manufacturing, electronics, tourism,
            agriculture, and services. The country benefits from its strategic location, natural resources, and growing
            middle class.
    
            Emigrating to Mexico is feasible through various pathways, including temporary and permanent residency visas,
            retirement visas, and work visas. The country welcomes expatriates, retirees, and investors who can contribute
            to its economy and cultural diversity.
    
            In summary, Mexico offers a blend of cultural richness, economic opportunities, and natural beauty. Its warm
            climate, affordable cost of living, and friendly atmosphere make it an attractive destination for individuals
            and families seeking a vibrant Latin American experience.</p>
