                Hungary, located in Central Europe, is known for its rich history, thermal spas, and vibrant cultural scene.
                Budapest is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 10 million people. Hungarian is the
                official language, and the currency is the Hungarian Forint (HUF). Hungary operates as a parliamentary republic.
                <br><br>
                People are attracted to living in Hungary for its affordable cost of living, historical architecture, cultural
                festivals, and central location within Europe. Notable personalities from Hungary include Ferenc Puskás
                (footballer), Béla Bartók (composer), and Ernő Rubik (inventor of the Rubik's Cube).
                <br><br>
                Hungary's minimum wage in 2024 is approximately 200,000 HUF per month, roughly equivalent to 650 USD. The
                healthcare system provides universal coverage through both public and private sectors. Education is free and
                compulsory up to age 16, with higher education options subsidized by the state.
                <br><br>
                Politically, Hungary is a member of the European Union and functions under a parliamentary system. The country is
                divided into counties and municipalities, each with local governance. In recent years, there have been
                discussions about the balance of democratic institutions and government authority.
                <br><br>
                The cost of living in Hungary remains affordable compared to Western Europe, with Budapest being the most
                expensive city. Housing and utilities are generally reasonable, making it an appealing destination for
                expatriates and digital nomads.
                <br><br>
                The economy is diversified, focusing on automotive manufacturing, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture.
                Hungary also benefits from its position as a logistical hub connecting Eastern and Western Europe.
                <br><br>
                In summary, Hungary offers a mix of cultural richness, economic opportunity, and affordable living. With its
                historical charm, European connectivity, and welcoming people, it’s an ideal place for those seeking balance
                between tradition and modernity.
