        <!-- <img src="../Flags/North Korea.png" alt="ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡µ Flag of North Korea" class="imgFlag"> -->
        <p class="FormatP">North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), is a highly secretive and
            isolated country located in East Asia. Pyongyang is the capital and largest city, with a population estimated
            around 25 million people. Korean is the official language, and the country operates under a single-party
            socialist republic led by the Workers' Party of Korea.
    
            North Korea's closed political system and strict control over information make it challenging to ascertain
            detailed information about daily life, economy, and living conditions. The country is known for its centralized
            government control, extensive military presence, and ideological adherence to Juche (self-reliance) ideology.
    
            People's daily lives in North Korea are heavily regulated by the state, with limited access to outside
            information and controlled access to international communication channels. The government provides essential
            services such as healthcare and education, although access and quality vary significantly across regions and
            socioeconomic groups.
    
            Economic activities in North Korea are primarily state-controlled, with agriculture, mining, and manufacturing
            being key sectors. The country faces significant economic challenges, including international sanctions, limited
            foreign investment, and outdated infrastructure.
    
            Emigration from North Korea is highly restricted and controlled by the government. Most international movements
            are tightly regulated, and defection attempts can result in severe consequences for individuals and their
            families.
    
            In summary, North Korea remains one of the world's most closed and authoritarian states, with limited access to
            accurate information about daily life and conditions for its population. The country's political system,
            economic challenges, and strict controls on personal freedoms contrast sharply with norms in most other
            countries globally.</p>
