        Imagine living surrounded by mountains, breathing fresh air, and enjoying one of the safest and most peaceful
        lifestyles in Europe. <strong>Andorra</strong> isn’t just a small country — it’s a hidden gem nestled between
        France and Spain that offers a life of calm, stability, and opportunity.

        With a population of around <strong>77,000 inhabitants</strong> and its capital in <strong>Andorra la Vella</strong>,
        this principality speaks <strong>Catalan</strong> and uses the <strong>euro (€)</strong> as its currency.
        It is governed uniquely by two co-princes: the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell.
        </p>

        <p class="FormatP">
        People choose Andorra for its <strong>low taxes</strong>, <strong>high quality of life</strong>, and
        <strong>stunning natural landscapes</strong>. The country attracts entrepreneurs, digital nomads,
        and anyone who dreams of a peaceful life close to nature but with modern comforts.
        </p>

        <p class="FormatP">
        The <strong>minimum wage</strong> in 2024 is about €1,157/month. Education is trilingual (Catalan, French, and
        Spanish), healthcare is efficient and modern, and crime rates are almost nonexistent. Political stability and
        fiscal advantages make Andorra a favorite for professionals seeking balance and privacy.
        </p>

        <p class="FormatP">
        Moving to Andorra is accessible through different residency types:
        <strong>active residence</strong> (for work),
        <strong>passive residence</strong> (for financially independent individuals),
        or <strong>investment residency</strong> (through real estate or business).
        </p>

        <p class="FormatP">
        Life here is calm, clean, and inspiring — perfect for those who want to escape stress and embrace simplicity.
        However, accommodation costs and strict immigration requirements demand careful planning.
