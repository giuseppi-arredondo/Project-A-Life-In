        <p class="FormatP">Sweden, located in Northern Europe, is known for its progressive social policies, stunning natural landscapes,
            and high quality of life. Stockholm is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 10.5
            million people. Swedish is the official language, and the currency is the Swedish Krona (SEK). Sweden operates
            as a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy.
    
            People are attracted to living in Sweden for its strong welfare system, beautiful nature (including forests,
            lakes, and islands), innovative design (such as IKEA), and emphasis on work-life balance. Notable personalities
            from Sweden include Ingmar Bergman (film director), Greta Thunberg (environmental activist), and Zlatan
            IbrahimoviÄ‡ (footballer).
    
            Sweden's minimum wage is not set by law but is determined through collective bargaining agreements between trade
            unions and employers, ensuring fair compensation across various sectors. The healthcare system in Sweden is
            universal and publicly funded, providing comprehensive medical services to all residents. Education is free and
            compulsory up to the age of 16, with further education heavily subsidized for higher levels.
    
            Politically, Sweden is known for its stable democracy, with a strong tradition of social democracy and welfare
            state policies. The country is divided into counties and municipalities, each with its own local government and
            administrative responsibilities.
    
            The cost of living in Sweden varies by region, with Stockholm and other major cities generally more expensive
            than rural areas. Housing, utilities, and food costs are significant expenses, though salaries typically reflect
            the higher costs in urban centers. Social benefits such as healthcare, education, and generous parental leave
            policies contribute to the high quality of life.
    
            Sweden's economy is diverse, with key industries including manufacturing (automobiles, telecommunications
            equipment), services (IT and finance), pharmaceuticals, and renewable energy. The country has a strong focus on
            innovation, sustainability, and gender equality, supporting economic growth and social development.
    
            Emigrating to Sweden is feasible through various pathways, including work visas, study visas, and family
            reunification visas. The country welcomes skilled professionals, students, and families who can contribute to
            its economy and cultural diversity.
    
            In summary, Sweden offers a blend of social progressiveness, economic stability, and natural beauty. Its Nordic
            lifestyle, environmental consciousness, and commitment to equality make it an attractive destination for
            individuals and families seeking a balanced and prosperous life in Northern Europe.</p>
