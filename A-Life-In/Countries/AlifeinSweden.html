                Sweden, located in Northern Europe, is known for its progressive social policies, stunning natural landscapes,
                and high quality of life. Stockholm is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 10.5
                million people. Swedish is the official language, and the currency is the Swedish Krona (SEK). Sweden operates
                as a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy.

                People are attracted to living in Sweden for its strong welfare system, beautiful nature (including forests,
                lakes, and islands), innovative design (such as IKEA), and emphasis on work-life balance. Notable personalities
                from Sweden include Ingmar Bergman (film director), Greta Thunberg (environmental activist), and Zlatan
                Ibrahimović (footballer).

                Sweden's minimum wage is not set by law but is determined through collective bargaining agreements between trade
                unions and employers, ensuring fair compensation across various sectors. The healthcare system in Sweden is
                universal and publicly funded, providing comprehensive medical services to all residents. Education is free and
                compulsory up to the age of 16, with further education heavily subsidized for higher levels.

                Politically, Sweden is known for its stable democracy, with a strong tradition of social democracy and welfare
                state policies. The country is divided into counties and municipalities, each with its own local government and
                administrative responsibilities.
                <br><br>
                The cost of living in Sweden varies by region, with Stockholm and other major cities generally more expensive
                than rural areas. Housing, utilities, and food costs are significant expenses, though salaries typically reflect
                the higher costs in urban centers. Social benefits such as healthcare, education, and generous parental leave
                policies contribute to the high quality of life.
                <br><br>
                Sweden's economy is diverse, with key industries including manufacturing (automobiles, telecommunications
                equipment), services (IT and finance), pharmaceuticals, and renewable energy. The country has a strong focus on
                innovation, sustainability, and gender equality, supporting economic growth and social development.
                <br><br>
                Emigrating to Sweden is feasible through various pathways, including work visas, study visas, and family
                reunification visas. The country welcomes skilled professionals, students, and families who can contribute to
                its economy and cultural diversity.
