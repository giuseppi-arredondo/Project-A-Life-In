        <p class="FormatP">Russia, the largest country in the world by land area, spans Eastern Europe and Northern Asia, known for its
            rich history, diverse culture, and vast landscapes. Moscow is the capital and largest city, with a population of
            approximately 144 million people. Russian is the official language, and the currency is the Russian Ruble (RUB).
            Russia operates as a federal semi-presidential republic.
    
            People are attracted to living in Russia for its cultural heritage, unique architecture (such as the Kremlin and
            Saint Basil's Cathedral), literary tradition (with authors like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky), and opportunities for
            outdoor activities in its expansive wilderness. Notable personalities from Russia include Vladimir Putin
            (President), Leo Tolstoy (writer), and Maria Sharapova (tennis player).
    
            Russia's minimum wage varies by region, with the federal minimum wage set at approximately 13,300 RUB per month,
            which is roughly equivalent to 160 USD depending on the exchange rate. The healthcare system in Russia is a mix
            of public and private providers, with challenges in accessibility and quality of care, particularly in rural
            areas. Education is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 15, with a strong emphasis on science and
            mathematics education.
    
            Politically, Russia is known for its complex political system, centralized governance, and strong presidential
            authority. The country is divided into federal subjects, including republics, regions, and territories, each
            with varying degrees of autonomy and local government structures.
    
            The cost of living in Russia varies significantly by region, with Moscow and St. Petersburg being more expensive
            compared to rural areas. Housing, utilities, and food costs are significant expenses, though living expenses can
            be relatively affordable depending on location.
    
            Russia's economy is diverse, with key industries including oil and gas production, manufacturing (especially
            aerospace and defense), mining, agriculture, and technology. The country has significant natural resources and
            plays a crucial role in global energy markets.
    
            Emigrating to Russia involves navigating various visa requirements and residency permits, depending on the
            purpose of relocation. The country welcomes skilled professionals, students, and investors who can contribute to
            its economy and cultural diversity.
    
            In summary, Russia offers a blend of historical richness, economic opportunities, and vast natural landscapes.
            Its complex political system, cultural diversity, and strategic importance in global affairs make it a unique
            destination for individuals and families seeking diverse experiences in Eurasia.</p>
