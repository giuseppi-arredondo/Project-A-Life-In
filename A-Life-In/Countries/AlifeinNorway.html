        <p class="FormatP">Norway, located in Northern Europe, is known for its stunning fjords, northern lights, high standard of living,
            and strong social welfare system. Oslo is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 5.4
            million people. Norwegian is the official language, and the currency is the Norwegian Krone (NOK). Norway
            operates as a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system.
    
            People are attracted to living in Norway for its natural beauty, outdoor recreational opportunities (such as
            hiking, skiing, and fishing), clean environment, and emphasis on work-life balance. Notable personalities from
            Norway include Edvard Munch (painter), Roald Amundsen (explorer), and Sonja Henie (figure skater).
    
            Norway's minimum wage system does not have a statutory minimum wage like many other countries. Instead, wages
            are typically set through collective bargaining agreements between trade unions and employers, ensuring fair
            compensation across various sectors. The healthcare system in Norway is universal and publicly funded, providing
            comprehensive medical services to all residents. Education is free and mandatory for children aged 6 to 16, with
            higher education heavily subsidized by the government.
    
            Politically, Norway is known for its stable democracy, strong institutions, and commitment to human rights and
            equality. The country is divided into counties and municipalities, each with its own local government and
            administrative responsibilities.
    
            The cost of living in Norway is relatively high, especially in cities like Oslo, Bergen, and Trondheim. Housing,
            utilities, and food costs are significant, though high wages and social benefits such as healthcare, education,
            and generous parental leave policies help offset these expenses.
    
            Norway's economy is prosperous and diversified, with key industries including petroleum and gas production,
            shipping, fisheries, forestry, and technology. The country has a strong focus on sustainable development and
            environmental conservation, supporting economic growth while preserving its natural resources.
    
            Emigrating to Norway is feasible through various pathways, including work visas, study visas, and family
            reunification visas. The country welcomes skilled workers, students, and investors who can contribute to its
            economy and cultural diversity.
    
            In summary, Norway offers a combination of natural beauty, economic stability, and high quality of life. Its
            progressive policies, strong social safety net, and emphasis on sustainability make it an attractive destination
            for individuals and families seeking a balanced and prosperous life in Northern Europe.</p>
