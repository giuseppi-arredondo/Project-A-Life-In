        <p class="FormatP">Italy, located in Southern Europe, is known for its rich history, cultural heritage, and iconic landmarks. Rome
            is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 60 million people. Italian is the official
            language, and the currency is the Euro (EUR). Italy operates as a parliamentary republic.
    
            People are attracted to living in Italy for its art, architecture, cuisine, Mediterranean climate, and diverse
            landscapes. Notable personalities from Italy include Leonardo da Vinci (artist and inventor), Sophia Loren
            (actress), and Andrea Bocelli (singer).
    
            Italy's minimum wage in 2024 is approximately 1,300 EUR per month, which is roughly equivalent to 1,450 USD
            depending on the exchange rate. The healthcare system in Italy is comprehensive, providing universal coverage
            through a mix of public and private providers. Education is free and compulsory from ages 6 to 16, with further
            education subsidized for higher levels.
    
            Politically, Italy is known for its vibrant democracy, with a diverse political landscape and regional autonomy.
            The country is divided into regions and provinces, each with its own local government and administrative
            structure.
    
            The cost of living in Italy varies significantly by region, with major cities like Rome, Milan, and Florence
            being more expensive than rural areas. Housing, utilities, and transportation costs are significant expenses,
            though salaries generally reflect the higher costs in urban centers.
    
            Italy's economy is diverse, with key industries including manufacturing (especially automotive and fashion),
            tourism, agriculture, and services. The country has a strong cultural and industrial heritage, contributing to
            its global influence and economic resilience.
    
            Emigrating to Italy is feasible through various pathways, including work visas, study visas, and family
            reunification visas. The country welcomes skilled workers, students, and investors who can contribute to its
            economy and cultural diversity.
    
            In summary, Italy offers a blend of cultural richness, economic opportunities, and Mediterranean lifestyle. Its
            historical significance, culinary delights, and artistic legacy make it an attractive destination for
            individuals and families seeking a vibrant European experience.</p>
