        <h1>A Life in Hungary</h1>
        <!-- <img src="../Flags/Hungary.png" alt="üá≠üá∫ Flag of Hungary" class="imgFlag"> -->
        <p class="FormatP">Hungary, located in Central Europe, is known for its rich history, thermal spas, and vibrant cultural scene.
            Budapest is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 10 million people. Hungarian is the
            official language, and the currency is the Hungarian Forint (HUF). Hungary operates as a parliamentary republic.
    
            People are attracted to living in Hungary for its affordable cost of living, historical architecture, cultural
            festivals, and central location within Europe. Notable personalities from Hungary include Ferenc Pusk√°s
            (footballer), B√©la Bart√≥k (composer), and Ern≈ë Rubik (inventor of the Rubik's Cube).
    
            Hungary's minimum wage in 2024 is approximately 200,000 HUF per month, which is roughly equivalent to 650 USD
            depending on the exchange rate. The healthcare system in Hungary provides universal coverage through a mix of
            public and private providers, with efforts to improve accessibility and quality of care. Education is free and
            compulsory up to the age of 16, with further education subsidized for higher levels.
    
            Politically, Hungary is a member of the European Union (EU) and operates within a democratic framework, though
            recent years have seen some controversies regarding democratic institutions and governance practices. The
            country is divided into counties and municipalities, each with its own local government and administrative
            responsibilities.
    
            The cost of living in Hungary is relatively affordable compared to Western European countries, with Budapest
            being the most expensive city. Housing, utilities, and food costs are moderate, making Hungary attractive for
            expatriates and retirees looking to stretch their budgets.
    
            Hungary's economy is diverse, with key industries including automotive manufacturing, electronics,
            pharmaceuticals, and agriculture. The country benefits from its strategic location as a transit hub in Central
            Europe, supporting trade and economic development.
    
            Emigrating to Hungary is feasible through various pathways, including work visas, study visas, and family
            reunification visas. The country welcomes skilled workers and investors who can contribute to its economy and
            cultural diversity.
    
            In summary, Hungary offers a blend of historical charm, cultural vibrancy, and economic potential. Its
            affordable cost of living, central European location, and welcoming atmosphere make it an attractive destination
            for individuals and families seeking opportunities in Europe.</p>
