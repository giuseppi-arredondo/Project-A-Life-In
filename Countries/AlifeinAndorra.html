    <p class="FormatP">Andorra, a small country in the Pyrenees between France and Spain, has a population of approximately 77,000
        inhabitants, with its capital being Andorra la Vella. Catalan is the official language and the euro (‚Ç¨) is the
        currency. It is a parliamentary principality governed by two co-princes: the President of France and the Bishop
        of Urgell.

        People are attracted to living in Andorra due to its low taxes, high security, excellent quality of life,
        mountainous landscapes, and opportunities for winter sports. Famous residents include Joaquim Rodr√≠guez (former
        cyclist), Philippe Gilbert (cyclist), and Albert Celades (former footballer).

        The minimum wage in 2024 is approximately 1,157 euros per month. The healthcare system is efficient and of high
        quality. Education is trilingual (Catalan, French, and Spanish) and free until the age of 16. Politically,
        Andorra is a parliamentary principality with a unicameral parliament.

        The cost of living can be high, especially in terms of accommodation, but low taxes offset other expenses.
        Emigrating to Andorra is relatively straightforward if financial and legal requirements are met, including
        options for active residence (employment), passive residence (sufficient financial resources), and investments
        in real estate or businesses.

        Andorra offers a tranquil, safe, and fiscally attractive life, though living there can be expensive and requires
        meeting specific immigration criteria.</p>
