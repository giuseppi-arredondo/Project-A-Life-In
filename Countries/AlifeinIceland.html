        <h1>A Life in Iceland</h1>
        <!-- <img src="../Flags/Iceland.png" alt="🇮🇸 Flag of Iceland" class="imgFlag"> -->
        <p class="FormatP">Iceland, located in the North Atlantic Ocean, is known for its stunning landscapes, geothermal hot springs, and
            vibrant culture. Reykjavik is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately 370,000 people.
            Icelandic is the official language, and the currency is the Icelandic Króna (ISK). Iceland operates as a
            parliamentary republic.
    
            People are attracted to living in Iceland for its pristine natural environment, outdoor recreational
            opportunities (such as hiking and whale watching), low crime rate, and strong sense of community. Notable
            personalities from Iceland include Björk (singer), Halldór Laxness (Nobel laureate in literature), and Jóhanna
            Sigurðardóttir (former Prime Minister).
    
            Iceland's minimum wage in 2024 is approximately 317,000 ISK per month, which is roughly equivalent to 2,500 USD
            depending on the exchange rate. The healthcare system in Iceland is publicly funded and provides universal
            coverage, ensuring access to comprehensive medical services for all residents. Education is free and compulsory
            up to the age of 16, with further education subsidized for higher levels.
    
            Politically, Iceland is known for its strong democratic traditions, gender equality, and transparent governance.
            The country is divided into regions and municipalities, each with its own local government and administrative
            responsibilities.
    
            The cost of living in Iceland is relatively high, particularly in Reykjavik and other urban areas. Housing,
            utilities, and imported goods can be expensive, though salaries and social benefits help mitigate these costs.
            Iceland's remote location and small population contribute to the higher costs of living.
    
            Iceland's economy is characterized by fisheries, renewable energy (geothermal and hydroelectric power), tourism,
            and high-tech industries. The country has a strong emphasis on sustainability and environmental protection,
            which are integral to its economic policies and development.
    
            Emigrating to Iceland is feasible through various pathways, including work visas, study visas, and family
            reunification visas. The country welcomes skilled workers, students, and entrepreneurs who can contribute to its
            economy and cultural diversity.
    
            In summary, Iceland offers a unique blend of natural beauty, cultural richness, and economic stability. Its
            commitment to sustainability, strong social welfare system, and high quality of life make it an attractive
            destination for individuals and families seeking a distinctive Northern European experience.</p>
