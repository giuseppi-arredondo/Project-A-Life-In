        <p class="FormatP">The United Kingdom (UK), consisting of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, is located off the
            northwest coast of mainland Europe. London is the capital and largest city, with a population of approximately
            67 million people. English is the official language, and the currency is the British Pound Sterling (GBP). The
            UK operates as a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy.
    
            People are attracted to living in the UK for its rich cultural heritage, world-class universities, diverse
            cities, and historic landmarks such as Buckingham Palace and Stonehenge. Notable personalities associated with
            the UK include William Shakespeare (playwright), Queen Elizabeth II (monarch), and Adele (singer).
    
            The minimum wage in the UK varies depending on age and is updated annually. As of 2024, the National Living Wage
            for workers aged 23 and over is approximately Â£9.50 per hour, equivalent to around Â£1,850 per month based on
            full-time work.
    
            The healthcare system in the UK is known as the National Health Service (NHS), providing comprehensive and
            largely free healthcare services to residents. Education is compulsory for children aged 5 to 18, with
            state-funded schools providing free education up to the age of 16, and further education available at colleges
            and universities.
    
            Politically, the UK is known for its stable democracy, with a parliamentary system and regular elections. It is
            divided into four constituent countries, each with its own devolved administration responsible for various
            aspects of public policy.
    
            The cost of living in the UK varies significantly by region, with London and the southeast generally being more
            expensive than other parts of the country. Housing, transportation, and food costs are major expenses, though
            salaries in urban areas often reflect the higher living costs.
    
            The UK's economy is diverse, with key industries including financial services (London is a global financial
            hub), manufacturing (automobiles, aerospace), pharmaceuticals, creative industries (film, music, fashion), and
            technology. The country has a strong emphasis on innovation and research, supporting economic growth and global
            competitiveness.
    
            Emigrating to the UK is possible through various pathways, including work visas, study visas, family
            reunification visas, and investment visas. The country welcomes skilled professionals, students, and
            entrepreneurs who can contribute to its economy and cultural diversity.
    
            In summary, the United Kingdom offers a blend of cultural richness, economic opportunities, and historical
            significance. Its global influence, educational excellence, and diverse society make it an attractive
            destination for individuals and families seeking a dynamic and multifaceted life in Europe.</p>
